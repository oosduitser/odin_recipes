    <h1>Easy Tamale Casserole</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
    <p>My mom liked to make the Hamburger Helper® version 
        of this recipe. When I moved to another state, 
        I could not find it, so I came up with this. <br> Memories of home.
         My hubby likes for me to spice this up sometimes, 
         so I will use a 14-ounce can of tomatoes and green chiles <br> 
         in it or just use a Mexican-style cornbread mix sometimes.</p>
        </div>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <div>
             <p>
             1 pound ground beef <br>
             ½ teaspoon salt <br>
             ½ teaspoon ground black pepper <br>
             1 small onion, chopped <br>
             2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained <br>
             2 (15 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes <br>
             1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn <br>
             1 (6 ounce) box cornbread mix <br>
             1 egg, lightly beaten <br>
             1 cup shredded Cheddar Cheese <br>
            </p>
            </div>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <div><p>
             Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
             Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  <br>
        Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
            5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. <br>
            Season beef with salt and pepper.
         Stir onion into the ground beef; cook and stir for 1 minute 
        and immediately <br>remove skillet from heat. 
     Stir pinto beans and crushed tomatoes into the beef mixture.
     Beat cream-style corn, <br>cornbread mix, and egg together in a bowl until smooth;
             spread over the top of the ground beef mixture<br> in the skillet.
             Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the corn mixture. 
 Bake in preheated oven until <br>the cheese is melted and the cornbread is set in the
          middle, about 25 minutes.
